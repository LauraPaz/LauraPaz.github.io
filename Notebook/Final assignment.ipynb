    "# 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *What is your dataset?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset consists of results of restaurant inspections in New York and is produced by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). It contains every sustained or not yet adjudicated violation citation from every full or special program inspection conducted up to three years prior to the most recent inspection for restaurants and college cafeterias in an active status on the date of the data pull. For the purpose of this project the whole dataset was utilized, ranging from 2011 up to 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular dataset was selected for a set of reasons. First of all, the subject of the dataset, restaurant inspections, is relevant to everyday life and might be interesting to a great deal of people. New York, as the world’s most famous city and home to probably the greatest variety of ethnic cuisines in the world, has a reputation of an exciting restaurant scene that is a destination by itself. We believe that a showcasing of the evolution of restaurant quality through time and its distribution through different parts of the city would appeal not only to New Yorker’s, but also to potential visitors and even Instagram foodies from all over the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the dataset offers a lot of information about restaurant inspections, including type of cuisine, type and severity of violation, region, date etc., giving a clear picture of the actual situation. This plethora of information allows us to combine different elements of the data and transform them into valuable insights for the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *What was your goal for the end user's experience?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the aim of this article is to capture the reader’s interest and inform about the quality of restaurants in NY in a creative and inventive way, utilizing visualization tools and convening information in an interactive and original manner."

    "# 2. Basic stats\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this dataset is compiled from several large administrative data systems, it contains some illogical values that could be a result of data entry or transfer errors. Data may also be missing. For this reason certain elements were removed or rearranged to prepare the dataset before creating the plots. First of all, certain restaurants that are in the dataset have not been inspected yet and show no results. These restaurants are noted as having an inspection date of 1/1/1900 and were observed as outliers in the bar plot below before being removed. Even though the dataset ranges between 2011 - 2023, it can be seen in the bar plots below that there is a very small number of occurrences for the years prior to 2018. This is because old inspections stay on the list only as long as there is a new inspection in the same restaurant in the last three years. For this reason, for the purpose of this project we focused only on inspections that happened after 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source of outliers was the notation \"0\" in the borough column, meaning that some restaurants were not registered with a correct location and as a result they were removed. Some columns that did not convey any valuable information for this project, such as 'Community Board','Council District','Census Tract' etc. were also removed. The null values in the dataset were investigated in orded to find out their amount in each column and if they interfere with the results. The different types of restaurants/cuisines were specified and those categories that comprised of a very small number of entries were dropped, as they were to small to help reach meaningful conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "After the data were cleaned, the number of total occurrences per year and their seasonality were investigated in order to get an idea of progress through time. The number of investigations per borough was also calculated to look for spatial patterns regarding the distribution of investigations and violations. This information was combined with the number of restaurants of each different type of cuisine to get interesting insights about the concentration of violations in each category, the distribution of grades and the types of violations."

    "# 3. Data Analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Describe your data analysis and explain what you've learned about the dataset.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we looked for is the distribution of inspections among districts. New York is divided in \"boroughs\", so with the help of a relevant geojson file we counted the number of inspections, types of violations and rates of violations and closures in each borough. The results of this analysis indicate that the absolute number of inspections and violations vary greatly between boroughs, with more than ten times more inspections taking place in Manhattan compared to Staten Island. The rate at which inspections end up having a negative outcome was found to be very similar between boroughs, and very high in general, being generally greater than 98%. It should be noted that this includes all types of possible violations, some of them being a bit trivial, e.g. not having a posted \"Wash Your Hands\" sign in the restroom. The number of inspections ending up in the closure of a restaurant was also calculated for each borough, and the rate of closures per inspection was found to be greater in Brooklyn than other areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "A closer look was taken on the grading system, the score achieved by each restaurant and the types of violations. In general, most inspections end up in an A grade, which is the best possible grade and means that no reinspection is needed for the restaurant. The probability density of each score was calculated, again strengthening the conclusion that even though most inspections end up finding violations, the vast majority ascore less than 13 points, meaning that the violations were not very important and that they receive an A grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis about the spatial distribution of inspections was taken one step further by repeating the previous steps for smaller areas (neighborhoods), in order to get a more detailed opinion about locations of violations. The \"Midtown-Midtown South\" neighborhood of Manhattan sticks out at first, with significantly more violations occurring there than any other neighborhood in NY. Upon a closer inspection however, it is observed that the rate of inspections ending up finding violations is not greater there than the rest of the city, leading to the conclusion that this neighborhood is probably dense with restaurants and therefore sees more inspections in general. Regarding inspections that end up in closures, it is notable that in the \"Grymes Hill-Clifton-Fox Hills\" neighborhood in Staten Island almost 20% of inspections ended up in the closure of the restaurant! \n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we focused on how inspections progressed through time for the period of interest. Here the most important, and admittedly expected, thing, is the total absence of inspections during the peak of the corona-virus pandemic. It is a fact that New York was hit very hard by COVID-19, being the city facing the most difficulties in the USA. Between the middle of March 2020 and July 2021, for the greatest part of which time restaurants were closed, almost no inspections took place, leaving a huge gap in the calendar analysis. In an attempt to compensate(?) for the lost time, inspections skyrocketed the following year, with more than three-times more inspections taking place in 2022 than 2019! This increase in the number of inspections holds true for all types of cuisines, with hunderds of inspections occuring almost every day in 2022 and even more moving into 2023. Looking in the number of inspections per season, we found that there are significantly more inspections taking place in the winter compared to other seasons, with the number of closures being proportional to the total inspections. The types of violations were analysed to see their progression through time. The result was that generally, the number of each type of violation spotted is proportional to the total number of inspections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, the distribution of inspections, violations and grades between the different types of cuisines was investigated. The distribution of grades was found to be relatively similar for all types of cuisines, with the majority receiving an A in most types. Chinese, Indian, Carribean and Jewish/Kosher restaurants have the lowest rate of A-grades among cuisines, with Donuts and Hamburgers standing out with the highest percentage of A-grades. \n"

    "\n",
    "The Genre that was chosen for this project is the Magazine Style genre. Like in the previous assignment, This form of narrative visualization was chosen because it allows great freedom in organizing the visuals and accompanying text in a way that is easy to read and most importantly is familiar to the reader. In terms of visual narrative, the article is characterised by a Consistent Visual Platform and Zooming can be used to highlight some details, e.g. in the choropleth maps. Some Motion is also introduced with gifs to make the narration lighter and easier to follow. The Narrative Structure is Linear, with a clear order of the elements that are analyzed, while Interactivity is strongly present with interactive bar plots and scatter maps. Messaging is also achieved by having an introductory text and some accompanying captions to gifs that help communication with the reader."
